# Webpage-changing-extension
This extension changes the elements on a webpage and is aimed at aiding those with dyslexia 

The extension was built as part of my honours dissertation and this repository is a archive for the code. I feel this idea could benefit people aswell so feel free to use the code if you want to build upon it.

## Installation

As this is not publish files need to be installed manually. Unlike chrome, firefox requires a temporary add on which deletes when the browser is installed as fully installed browsers need to be passed by Mozilla for signing. If you want to install or make any changes to the code how to install...

Chrome:

-Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
-The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
-Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
-Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.
-Load Extension

Firefox:

-Open the extensions management page by navigating to about:addons.
-Select the cog/settings menu on that page and select "Debug add-ons"
-Click "Load temporary add on" and select extension directory
